        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

        <p>

        Have you ever wondered why some people sleep later or earlier than others or why your sleep times are seasonal? Did you know that even fungi make spores earlier or later than their relatives each day? <br> <br>Daily rhythms &#45; from gene expression to behavior &#45; are everywhere in nature and they form a web of rhythmic interactions. In this website offering, you will be taught about the science on daily or circadian clocks. <br><br> We will discuss a variety of biological clock systems from bacteria to humans and will explain how circadian systems are organized and the many ways that circadian clocks control our lives. 

        </p>

  <div class = "intro2">

    <h3>Have you ever..</h3>

    <p>

    Take the red-eye from California to New York, and experienced firsthand the effects of your body's internal clock? <br><br>If you feel drowsy or "jet lagged" after the flight, it's because there's been a disruption to your natural circadian rhythms. Your internal clock is saying it's 3 am, but outside, it's time for breakfast.

    </p>

    <h3>So what is the internal clock?</h3>

    <p>

Living organisms evolved an internal biological clock, called the circadian rhythm, to help their bodies adapt to the daily cycle of day and night (light and dark) as the Earth rotates every 24 hours. <br><br>The term "circadian" comes from the Latin words for about (circa) a day (diem).

    </p>

  </div>



  <div class = "intro4">

    <h3>Why is circadian rhythm important?</h3>

    <p>

Circadian rhythm controls various functions, including when we sleep and rest, and when we are awake and active. <br><br>Circadian rhythms also control body temperature, heart activity, hormone secretion, blood pressure, oxygen consumption, metabolism, and many other functions.<br><br>Our internal clocks may even influence our mood, particularly in the form of wintertime depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
